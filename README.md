# Deep-Autoencoder-Networks-for-Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection--A-Study-in-Anomaly-Detection
This project uses autoencoders, an unsupervised deep learning model, to detect credit card fraud. By learning to reconstruct normal transactions, the model identifies anomalies that may indicate fraudulent activity. It enhances fraud detection efficiency by leveraging anomaly detection in financial datasets.
